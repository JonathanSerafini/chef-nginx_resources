nginx_resources cookbook
========================

Installs nginx and dependant modules from source in a modular fashion.

Status
------

This is an initial release of the cookbook which has been through minor non-exhaustive testing. Additional work needs to be done to test more extensively as well as to flesh out the documentation. That being said, the interfaces ought to be fairly consistent moving forward.

Requirements
------------

### Chef

This cookbook requires Chef 12.7 and above.

### Platforms

At present, only Ubuntu < 16.04 is supported, however adding support for other distributions should be a simple matter.
